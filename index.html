      This story is a reflection on the relationships I have developed and the way they inspire me. Through the strength of community, surrounded by love and support, even the largests tasks dont seem as daunting. So even if things start to get bad and you find yourself falling short of your goal, like the winter iris, the path youve tread so far and those youve met along the way are a gentle reminder that there are brighter days ahead.
